# Goal
<ul>
<li>Create a bot that would be able to traverse a maze. A maze should be generated randomly, but it should have a solution (treasure). Because this is a web app; simulation should be done in HTML/JS.</li>
<li>Add Django to include Python functionalities.</li>
<li>Add independence to the bot using a neural network.</li>
<li>Train neural network.</li>
<li>Users should be able to adjust weights of neural network manually.</li>
</ul>

<h3>So far ... </h3>
